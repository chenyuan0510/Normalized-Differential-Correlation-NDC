1） MATLAB is the tool of NDC;
2)  Make sure that c++ has installed in your computer;
3)  Running program “make.m” to compile the getsuper2var and getmutualI2var_fix4;
4)  Running program NDC_index to calculate NDC and get the oder of each feature;
    [NDC_score,ordered_index,threshold_mic]=NDC_index(data,num_ndc)
