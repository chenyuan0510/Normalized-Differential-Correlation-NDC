# normalized-differential-correlation-NDC-
To highlight nonlinear expressed genes efficiently

[NDC_score,ordered_index,threshold_mic]=NDC_index(data,num_ndc)
NDC_score is the NDC score of each feature;
ordered_index is the importance ranking for each feature in descending order;
num_ndc is the threshold of nonlinear relationship, must less than the number of features
